#' @description Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. Age and ingredients have a highly nonlinear effect on concrete compressive strength. The data set includes 1030 instances with 8 independent variables and 1 dependent variable.
#' @details
#' Independent Variables: Cement (kg in a metric cubic mixture), Blast Furnace Slag (kg in
#' a metric cubic mixture), Fly Ash (kg in a metric cubic mixture), Water (kg in a metric cubic
#' mixture), Superplasticizer (kg in a metric cubic mixture), Coarse Aggregate (kg in a metric cubic
#' mixture), Fine Aggregate (kg in a metric cubic mixture), and Age (days).
#'
#' Dependent Variable: Concrete compressive strength (MPa).
