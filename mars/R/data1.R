#' Independent Variables: F1 (total surface area), F2 (non-polar exposed area), F3 (fractional
#' area of exposed non-polar residue), F4 (fractional area of exposed non-polar part of residue), F5
#' (molecular mass weighted exposed area), F6 (average deviation from standard exposed area of
#' residue), F7 (Euclidian distance), F8 (secondary structure penalty), and F9 (Spacial Distribution
