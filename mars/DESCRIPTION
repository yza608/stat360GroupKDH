Description: 
  MARS is a non-parametric regression technique that partitions the predictor space into simple regions defined by piecewise linear functions of the input variables. 
  The MARS algorithm uses a forward stepwise approach to iteratively add basis functions to the model. This is done until a specified maximum number of functions or 
  a stopping criterion is reached. Then, a backward stepwise approach is used to prune the model by removing any basis functions that do not contribute significantly 
  to the modelâ€™s performance.
